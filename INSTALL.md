Installation Instructions
=========================

From the Chrome Web Store
-------------------------
Download and install the extension from here: [Chrome Web Store - Tredolist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tredolist/ccdkhfdflkpacnhjcefjlhlaopfgjkab)

From source
-----------
1. Clone the repository. If you haven't used git before, then download the [zip archive](https://github.com/gwened/tredolist/archive/master.zip) instead, and unzip it.
2. Open the Chrome Extensions page: `chrome://extensions/`
3. If you previously installed the version from the Chrome Web Store, disable it.
4. Turn on Developer Mode.
5. Click "Load unpacked extension...".
6. Select the `tredolist` directory.

*Note*: It is recommended that after testing you remove the extension installed from source, and re-enable the version from the Chrome Web Store. Extensions installed from source will not automatically receive updates.
